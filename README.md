# coronow-local-cities
This is a COVID-19 dashboard that helps citizens of Massachusetts get a better understanding of the local situation. It shows the number of cases and deaths by county, using graphs to visualize the cases in easy to understand time-series graph. This project is built on top of the original Coronow project built by user etcho, whose dashboard showed data at the global and country levels. This project is designed to give a better sense of the situation directly around people in Massachusetts, giving them a more accurate understanding that is not enlarged or diminished by the large statistics at the global and country levels.

The data is gathered from https://github.com/sjuim/covid19-mass-data.
